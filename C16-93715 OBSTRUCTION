Forward Guidance

This Zucker family and their counselors decided to film 

the " interior of my apartment without my consent ";

   
 - then decided to distribute the videos without my consent and transferred the unlawful rents and leases to State Farm, under Filer CIK 93715, managed by a FINRA regulated broker dealer, State Farm VP Management Corp, and it’s Directors.

 FILED on the 24TH, of November ]


I filed on the November 13th, 2021, had I not been obstructed, the TCR I filed with the SEC and on the front page very clearly articulated: OMISSIONS.

- to prevent this LARGER EMBODIMENT in CIK 15156523.


thus OBSTRUCTION is not GOOD for THOSE who UNDERSTAND when I file a TCR is OFFICIAL, and used to their advantage as Insider Trades


per the holding report filed by Terrence Ludwig, Paul J Smith and other  compliance officers and Directors of 

State Farm VP Management Corp., I am certain those securities were traded by Morgan Stanley without any disclosure to other market participants.

     

 ##  WHEN I am CERTAIN

I do NOTIFY parties which in part is a failure on the PART OF THE CURRENT "PROMOTERS"

1.  to make these undisclosed / unregistered securities public and make them available to the General PUBLIC for consideration prior to making an investment. 

- and also in the Central Registration Depository by the Representatives at State Farm VP. FIRM 43036...

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.    
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    November 22, 2021
    We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

Item B.14. Provision of financial support.
Instruction. For purposes of this Item, a provision of financial support includes any (1) capital contribution, (2) purchase of a security from a Money Market Fund in reliance on rule 17a-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.17a-9), (3) purchase of any defaulted or devalued security at fair value reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's portfolio, (4) execution of letter of credit or letter of indemnity, (5) capital support agreement (whether or not the Registrant ultimately received support), (6) performance guarantee, or (7) other similar action reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's portfolio. Provision of financial support does not include any (1) routine waiver of fees or reimbursement of Registrant's expenses, (2) routine inter-fund lending, (3) routine inter-fund purchases of Registrant's shares, or (4) action that would qualify as financial support as defined above, that the board of directors has otherwise determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's portfolio.

Hey Josephine good evening,

I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Gorman received NOTICE earlier, and so I filed these two CRD reports to make sure that her was alerted to this effect. I later sent it to institutional sales that I found on the Bloomberg Terminal, also to the attorneys as referenced below in a Material Filing which carries several problems as referenced in the language of the EX-99.CERT and EX-99.906CERT.

BELOW MY SIGNATURE ARE THE DOCUMENTS I USED TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS IMMEDIATELY AND TO AVOID ANY FURTHER LOSSES.

- even when I confirm the receipt of my files in the Pryor

    - and obtain those confirmations of filings which have been overlooked.

- but again... for those who absolutely DO NOT WANT ME TO FILE, or don't like that I file

    - I already FILED.
--- PLUS ALSO, I would like to inform you... that I also don't want to file as well.
OTHER THAN when I do FILE something that FILE-hater doesn't like.

also... for those who also get OBSTRUCTED, or HARASSED by the STATE FARM OF ZUCKER FOR YEARS...

- make sure you use the words FILE, and FILE time and time again--- because THEY HATE on files, like PHd.
--- and quite frankly. i am also a hater of file-haters and I have been hating all day

- but mostly because I read about a stage-4 situation. as, timing IS ALSO CRITICAL...

--- quicker than RICKY HENDERSON like the 24TH of November, and after that as well, also earlier...

filed in NY SUPREME MATTER 153974/2020 - was FILED... OBSTRUCTED, AND EGREGIOUSLY.

Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.    
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.
