Local Law 1 of 2004 - Lead-Based Paint
(Lead-Based Paint)
Local Law 1 of 2004 establishes that there is a presumption of lead-based paint in a building if it is 1) tenant occupied; 2) built prior to 1960; and 3) a child under the age of six resides in the unit. "Resides" means to live in the apartment or to routinely spend ten or more hours in the apartment each week. The law outlines requirements for identifying where a child under 6 resides, required even if the owner believes they know the ages of the occupants, and how those apartments must be maintained. The law has additional requirements for all tenant-occupied apartments built prior to 1960, regardless of the age of the occupants. The law applies to studio apartments (zero bedroom) as well. The law also applies to buildings built between 1960 and 1978 if lead-based paint is known to exist. Owners must retain records of all of the required activities for at least 10 years and provide the records to HPD on request. HPD may audit these records and is more likely to do so if your building has a history of lead-based paint violations or other indications of poor maintenance. Penalties may be significant for failure to conduct these activities and maintain these records. More information is available on the HPD website, including sample forms to assist with recordkeeping: nyc.gov/lead-based-paint.


Exemption: Major alterations to the building do not automatically exempt the building from these requirements. In order to be exempt from the requirements, an owner must apply for and receive exemption issued directly from HPD. The application for exemption is available on the HPD lead-based paint webpage. There are additional reasons a building may be excluded from the requirements of Local Law 1 and those are addressed under Question 1.


Year Built: HPD records indicate that your building was built prior to 1960 or, if built between 1960 and 1978, has had lead-based paint violations issued, which indicates the presence of lead-based paint. Under both of these year-built parameters, you are required to comply with the requirements of Local Law 1. If you disagree with the year built in HPD records (meaning your Certificate of Occupancy (COO) shows that a new building was erected after January 1, 1960), please email HPD at codevios@hpd.nyc.gov and provide the following so HPD can update its records: building address; borough; and correct information for the year built, including supporting documentation such as the COO. Note: Major alterations do not affect the year-built requirements. See "Exemption" above.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.
