If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to:  FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit, Justice Management Division, Room 115, LOC Building, Washington, D.C. 20530-0001, Attention:  FOIA Request.  You may also send your request to the Mail Referral Unit via e-mail (MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov) or fax ((202) 616-6695).  Personnel in that division will then forward your request to the DOJ component(s) it determines are most likely to maintain the records you are seeking. 


do you understand how STUPID these people are?
