Opinions on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.    
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    November 22, 2021
    We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

Hey Josephine good evening,

I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Gorman received NOTICE earlier, and so I filed these two CRD reports to make sure that her was alerted to this effect. I later sent it to institutional sales that I found on the Bloomberg Terminal, also to the attorneys as referenced below in a Material Filing which carries several problems as referenced in the language of the EX-99.CERT and EX-99.906CERT.

BELOW MY SIGNATURE ARE THE DOCUMENTS I USED TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS IMMEDIATELY AND TO AVOID ANY FURTHER LOSSES.

- even when I confirm the receipt of my files in the Pryor

    - and obtain those confirmations of filings which have been overlooked.

- but again... for those who absolutely DO NOT WANT ME TO FILE, or don't like that I file

    - I already FILED.
--- PLUS ALSO, I would like to inform you... that I also don't want to file as well.
OTHER THAN when I do FILE something that FILE-hater doesn't like.

also... for those who also get OBSTRUCTED, or HARASSED by the STATE FARM OF ZUCKER FOR YEARS...

- make sure you use the words FILE, and FILE time and time again--- because THEY HATE on files, like PHd.
--- and quite frankly. i am also a hater of file-haters and I have been hating all day

- but mostly because I read about a stage-4 situation. as, timing IS ALSO CRITICAL...
--- quicker than RICKY HENDERSON like the 24TH of November, and after that as well, also earlier...
filed in NY SUPREME MATTER 153974/2020 - was FILED... OBSTRUCTED, AND EGREGIOUSLY.

so file away Miss Daugherty! and also use the word ANNEX as frequently as possible...
--- only because State Farm hates that word, and I


this for example, is also fantastic when people HATE on confirmations...

      WHICH have been filed, and also delivered

and ADDITIONALLY well received.

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinions

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.    
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies in Advisers Investment Trust since 2011.

STATE FARM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 3487   



Opinions on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (four of the funds constituting Advisers Investment Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the “Funds”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the statements of changes in net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020, including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of September 30, 2021, the results of each of their operations for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and the year ended November 30, 2020, the changes in each of their net assets for the period December 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2020 and each of the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinions***These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

I ALSO PROVIDED TO MISS DOUGHERTY & HER COUNSELORS AS WELL..
- SO LET ME KNOW IF THOSE CRDs ARE NOT REFLECTING THE DOCKET, AND LOSSES FOR THE $9000.00 AUDIT AS WELL FOR $170,000.00 PAID IN POSTAGE.

1.    “UNREGISTERED SECURITY” and a 'FIDELITY' of State Farm Assurances Funds Trust, under its Principals is ANNEXED in NYSCEF Matter 153974/2020, as is the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust but is not disclosed under B.14 had been omitted in the new IA, ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST as well.
2.    Omissions held at the new Investment Adviser are tucked from the public eye, absent of their Promoters in the earlier fund, which DECIDED TO NO LONGER EXIST.
3.    The premiums and interest paid by the Sullivan Properties LP to State Farm are unreasonable with respect to the properties they guarantee, as the Tax payments are an assurance in the Loan I annexed in the matter of 153974/2020 which was in a NY Supreme Court so we have a failure by all members of State Farm VP Management Corp, who executed and Notarized the Loan 50074.                     
5.    OBSTRUCTION.       I requested to amend the CAPTION to include all material parties, notwithstanding the ENTITY in the scope of this Loan 50074, having NOT indemnified themselves in the event of an issue of insolvency; where reimbursement would be impossible.
6.    INVESTOR RISK EXPOSURE.      10-years of erroneous reports and linear growth in income generated an automatic PROPERTY VALUE ASSESSMENT [NOPV] by the NY Dept. of Taxation, which was paid quarterly and for the last-15 years. The penalties, compounded interest, and for 10-YEARS is approximately $50,000,000.00; and was calculated on the basis of the property taxes reported and paid as promulgated by the NY Dept of Finance and Taxation, is so not authorized to conduct investment banking transactions or structure Loans for clients in the State of New York (Harbert) who is affiliated and as a director of State Farm Lloyds and the State Farm Assurances Trust.
7.    CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.         EVASION with INTENT is understood as seen in the proceedings and NY tax records for all properties, which have reported YoY double digit gains in the estimates and also the receipts for the buildings to obtain a $6,000,000.00 (six million dollar loan) collateralized by those assets and guaranteed in letter of credit from State Farm, issued those monies to the SULLIVAN PROPERTIES LP and the NOTE 50074 was secured by the unlawful fees, rents, and leases which are not permitted to be held at a US depository, per the FDIC, without a certificate of occupancy - present an indeterminate risk and liability to its investors without any DISCLOSURE by any Member of State Farm VP Management Corp (FINRA MEMBER 43036) and its PROMOTERS (MS), as contemporaneous notice of the TCR filed on November 13th, 2021 was also provided to MS on November 16th, 2021; and again on December 18th, 2021 as their “Promoters of consistent and correct information…” received premiums and without any public records which demonstrate any responsibility as their fiduciary roles to both the investors and risks as seen in the losses observed in the losses by the four tickers now under the management of ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST.
     As far as the opportunity cost for the investors who blindly invested their assets into the surviving IA, could have placed the money into a safer and similar holding company like ticker: BRK-B, without having to take advantage of the underlying information and holdings which are reported by Mr. Monk and without and Level 3 exposure, who works with Mr.Harbert at STATE FARM VP MANAGEMENT CORP as its Principal at the State Farm Assurances Trusts In the prior.
      Bonds, Stocks, and other derivatives more likely than not were used to their advantage in addition to the premiums received by MORGAN STANLEY, and at the sacrifice of certain obligations to the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust also obtained payments to “better promote the quality of information…” and without consideration of the implications to aiding and abetting to the taxes avoided by the Sullivan Properties LP, as referenced hereunder, which also poses a huge threat to the current investors of ADVISERS INVESTMENT TRUST, do not report this in their public filings, and by their new Compliance Officer 'LUDWIG' from the prior is licensed with State Farm VP management Corp as its Chief compliance Officer.
       11-30-2021 Annual Report reported 'LUDWIG' 'Monk' and later Nasdaq for the closing prices ending on 03-31-2022 under the new Adviser is also “Not Covered” for the Omission and losses registered, whereby the Compliance officer has not DISCLOSED the Loan, legal proceedings, and compensated the C.16 Brokers — despite having knowledge of Loan 50074 in the matter of New York Supreme 153974/2020.
     I discovered and annexed upon discovery of no Certificate of Occupancy those risks in June of 2020 and for several buildings owned and operated by the recipient of the cash for Loan 50074, which was credited by State Farm, and located at one State Farm Plaza was also Notarized by its FIDELITY under the blanket of the SFITX 40-17G indenture.
8.   CUSTODY RISK.      JP Morgan has stepped aside as its custodian, however the Loan 50074 has caused a certain loss and at the cost of $912,500.00, it was decided that a merge me into a larger body of risk; despite having doubled their limit of their AUDIT expense… are not covered for the Omissions and by their own indenture for the losses suffered for a failure to DISCLOSE the legal proceedings, Loan, have DISCLOSED the Directors as “Covered” for Omissions after having absorbed nearly $900,000,000.00 (nine hundred million dollars) in losses and in the first quarter of 2022.
The last and final report by the CIK 931715 in 11-30-2021 as ASSETS transferred to the new Adviser [151…] lost these monies as accounted for each ticker and using the link below.
9.    AUDIT FEES.      Under the indenture and limit of liability in the prior, we’re “Not Covered” hence paid $9,000.00 I’m accounting with Price Waterhouse as their sole accounting firm, however did check off a box to set aside certain expenses for the future and in the new umbrella, which was increased from $25,000 to $50,000 however is not covered given the total assets under management which accepts a minimum investments at $250.00 and in $50.00 increments, and paid $170,000.00 in postage to main those “proxies” and during the interim period of “Merger” the Directors of State Farm VP Management Corp also paid themselves roughly $400,000.00 in “Director Fees”.
10.    UNFAIR DEALINGS.      Morgan Stanley accounted YoY payments in FY2020, FY2021, and in 2020 accounted a partial payment for the interim period and in their fiduciary roles permitted for other to enjoin without any notice of disclosure both to the other “Brokers” under C.16 and to the investors who suffered losses at the GROSS NEGLIGENCE also may have also taken advantage of the imminent losses, with prior knowledge of the material and substance of the Loan, pending legal action, continued to further aid and abet to the above matters and also were paid to bring more investors into the New Adviser.
