The policy for recorded phone lines and records is in FACT three years at those FINRA regulated firms who DID participate in Securities Fraud, Unfair Dealings and an OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, as I recall. Thus, time is of the essence for those hoping to avoid getting crossed in their phone conversations and lines, which we can review later as well.

> confirmations attached, above.

"NOT COVERED" FOR OMISSIONS, and that ticker is not a PAR-ID, but is now SUB-PAR [STFGX]

- losses registered: THE excess of 1.35 billion US dollars - not Monopoly money.


THE LINKS IN THIS ATTACHMENT ARE EASIER TO CLICK AND REVIEW AS WELL.

ALL REFERENCES ARE PRIMARILY FILED IN THE MATTER OF NYSCEF 153974/2020, AND ALSO WITH THE DEPT. OF BUILDINGS.
- REGARDING THE UNLAWFUL RENTS AND LEASES TRANSFERRED TO STATE FARM IN MAY OF 2020, WERE ALL ANNEXED IN THE OMISSIONS AS SEEN IN THOSE SEC FILINGS, WHERE APPLICABLE.

   
MY APOLOGIES FOR THE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS AS WELL.

   

MOST RESPECTFULLY,

    A GENTLEMAN WHO I AM FAMILIAR WITH SINCE 2010.

    
THANK YOU GOVERNOR HOCHUL FOR YOU ASSISTANCE WITH THE GROSS MOLESTATION OF BOTH PROCEDURE AND A MOCKERY OF THE NEW YORK SUPREME COURT SYSTEM. More importantly, I also thank Expedia as well for their involvement.

    p.s. THE SMALLER FILE HAS LINKS THAT ARE EASIER TO HIT THAN PAR TWO AT AN EXECUTIVE 9.

    - also,  I haven't even had printer for the last two years, but I will call you later to discuss that with you privately.

ATTN:     STATE FARM
          ATTN: MR. MOORE, TIPSORD, HODGSON, HARBERTS, ET. AL.
          ONE STATE FARM PLAZA
          BLOOMINGTON, IL, 61710
    
      
TWO BRIEF POINTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION(S):
1. I REQUESTED AN ESTOPPEL:      
     re:    STATE FARM
https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=s5WAeCnxmd/hcOI4eTnbig==
     
2.  I REQUESTED AN ESTOPPEL:      
     re:    THE ZUCKER FAMILY & ITS COUNSELORS [ all of them ]
https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Jf3Un/JaVXZwF7kvbaee4w==

TO CEASE AND DESIST FROM ALL THE ACTIVITY / NOTWITHSTANDING FOOLING AROUND WITH A 40' ACT MUTUAL FUND.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EARLY RETIREMENT, YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE OTHERS WITH NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO AT ANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN BLOOMINGTON, OR YOUR BRANCHES IN NEW YORK.  

     
AKA     *** COST TO SETTLE OUT OF COURT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER " DISCOVERY " UPON KNOWLEDGE. 
*** TWENTY-FIVE MILLION UPFRONT ***
1.     LEGAL MATTERS CLOSED, ALL PRE-EXISTING ACTS WITH THE IMPLIED "COVERAGE" THEREAFTER, ON MY WATCH.
- I WILL PERSONALLY ASSIST YOU " FOR FREE " AND UNTIL THIS DISASTER YOUR ADVISORS HAVE LEFT YOU WITH IS CLEAR, AND TO YOUR SATISFACTION.

2.     UPFRONT â THAT IS MY COST.  
- IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL TEAM OF EXPERTS YOU'D LIKE TO HIRE AND CONSULT WITH TO DEAL WITH YOUR COMPANY'S AFFAIRS, THAT IS FINE BUT I MUST ALSO ABIDE BY MY OWN PRINCIPLES IN THAT RESPECT. I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY, BUT A PROFESSIONAL WHEN I NEED TO BE, AS REFERENCED BELOW MY SIGNATURE. YOUR $25 MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT LINE IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO COVER MY COSTS TO REPAIR THE FIRM.  FOR FREE, BUT ONLY AFTER WE SETTLE AND PUT ALL PRIOR MATTERS BEHIND TO LAWFULLY RESOLVE THE ISSUES YOU HAVE AT THE NEW 1516523.

- EVEN AFTER THE FACT, I CAN REPAIR IT ALL AND ALSO FOREGO THE VIOLATION OF PRIVACY TORTS, AND OTHER MATTERS WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO THE FORE.  

3.     IF YOU CONSIDER THE LOSSES SUFFERED & EVADED FOR THIS GROUP OF ZUCKERS AND THEIR TAX-EVASIONS THUS FAR.
- YOU WOULD HAVE SAVED YOU ABOUT $1.5 BILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN NOV 13, 2021 THROUGHT DEC 18, 2021 AND THE STATE FARM ADVISORS FUNDS TRUST COMPANY WOULD EXIST AND FUNCTION UNDER THE SAME FILER AND NAME.

- YOUR BROKERAGE GROUP AND ADVISORS DID NOT ACT ACCORDINGLY IN NOVEMBER OF 2021, OR UPON THE PRIOR NOTICE - WHICH IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR YOUR FIRM, AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

THE MISLEADING STATEMENTS THROUGHOUT YOUR FILINGS UNDER A DIFFERENT FUNCTION OF "DURESS" WHICH NOT DEFINED IN ANY ORDINARY BOOK OF LAW, AND IS GENERALLY FROWNED UPON IN ANY JURISDISTION FOR "PRACTICAL" CAUSE THAT IS ALSO REASONABLE, UNLIKE THE CAUSE TO "CEASE TO EXIST" AFTER 27-YEARS.        
    
- UNDER ADVISEMENT WITH A SEVERE CONFLICT OF INTEREST [ PRISON - FOR EXAMPLE ]
- OTHER MATTERS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T DISCLOSE AT THIS POINT - HENCE, A DISCOUNT.

I CAN ONLY WARN YOU "AGAIN" THAT YOUR ENTIRE CORPORATION IS AT RISK, NOT JUST YOUR CREDIT LINE OF STATE FARM AUTOMOTICE GROUP THAT WAS EXTENDED TO THE FOUR FUNDS MANAGED UNDER THE PRIOR AND NEW FILER 1516523 UNDER THE ASSURANCES FUNDS TRUST.

       - THE CREDIT LINE AT STATE FARM AUTOMOTIVE, WHICH LAST I CHECKED - IS IN TACT.
      
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP YOUR DAILY AFFIARS IN ORDER, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU REACH OUT AND CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
       - A BETTER USE OF YOUR CREDIT LINE ANYWAYS, FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES - IN MY OPINION.
       - TIME SENSITIVE, AS ALL THINGS ARE...
    
I SINCERELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU CALL ME AT YOUR EARLIEST COVENIENCE AT 646-256-3609.
