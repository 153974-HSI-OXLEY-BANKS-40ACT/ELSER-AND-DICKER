May 30th, 2022

Mr. Moore,
   
Judith Craig from the FDIC reached out and pointed out to Morgan Stanley as the brokerage arm with respect to this matter and in April. To no avail, have not responded and continue in their dealings without concern, even write research reports for your competitor [BRK-B] while collecting premiums for selling shares on a “part time” basis for you and yours.  
       
At this point, I don't expect the FDIC to review any of this directly - however I thank them for the guidance. The material party, as instructed by Miss Craig, has failed to respond to any substantive request to myself and also to your own Auditor, as filed with the Securities and Exchange commission.
     
In a separate message, Mr. Moore (State Farm) did reach out to me and I attempted to schedule a call, I also emailed a conglomerate of State Farm’s advisors and representatives who have failed to return or respond to my email, and despite the risks which are in fact a growing liability of State Farm on a daily basis. I believe there is a certain "conflict of interest", or a lack of understanding — which unfortunately is something that may come back to the FDIC and without further clarification from State Farm with respect to my position and during the period of my residency. 
     
I reached out to you in August of 2020 and solely based on what was reported in State Farm’s SEC filings and also with the New York City Department of Finance. This was to avoid a certain deterioration to the Assets held by State Farm, hence I must insist and warn you in advance — that any gross neglect as seen in the posthaste filings under the advisement of your brokers can and should be avoided.
      
In this instance, and without any “demand” for payment on my part, on the basis of the "frequency of penalties which are known" infractions by State Farm; historically are outweighed by the severity and consequences suffered by certain third party service providers – namely in their unfair dealings, neglect, and ethical procedures.
     
The Violation of Privacy issues are known by the executives and directors of Sullivan Properties LP, Morgan Stanley, notwithstanding the counselors and affiliated companies of the Zucker Organization. It is important that I speak with someone at State Farm to avoid a certain conflict, solely on the basis of the contractual obligations filed with the New York Department of Finance. Those omissions I have discovered as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission have created a paper trail of old and new investors that are invited, however bereft of the underlying risks prior to purchasing subscriptions in your umbrella of Mutual Funds. 
     
The extent of liability, and with my sole reliance on the provisions presented to Donald Zucker in writing on the 11th of May by “State Farm Realty Mortgage LLC”, as 'FIDELITY' of the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust —was and is reported by several Directors of both the “Investment Adviser” and “Broker Dealer” and under the new Advisers Investment Trust. 
     
This was executed under the former 'State Farm Assurances Funds Trust' in fiscal year 2020 and as of current is NOT understood as a substantive risk, and is not reported. Which is the reason why it is important that you make arrangements to speak with me as soon as possible. 
    
This artifact (“50074”) was notarized and by its managing agent “State Farm Life Insurance Company”, was filed while I resided at 111 Rear Sullivan Street, New York, NY, 10012. The degree of negligence and understanding by those counselors is deplorable as seen in the proceedings initiated by Sullivan Properties LP, however I can assure you this again a good faith attempt by myself to help you understand and explain to you where the omissions, obstruction, and conduct as exemplified by Morgan Stanley’s involvement is also reciprocated in the dictum of Pricewaterhouse Coopers. 
    
As it stands, you own the rights to the leases and rents for the six properties in question, and the covenants which are unique to each lot are complicated…
       
The fiduciary roles and opinions of your advisory in this respect are tainted, and also conflicted having on multiple occasions represented no concern having reviewed the semi-annual and annual reports on behalf of State Farm as their 'Promoters, and brokers'. Those statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission are the only means whereby an investors confidence and reliance of the risks implied for both the 'State Farm Assurances Funds Trust' are represented by the omissions of PWC, however due to the “non-responsive” brokers, as promulgated and filed under the new 'Advisers Investment Trust' by PWC. 
     
As an obligations of State Farm and the terms of its prospectus while operating as the State Farm Assurances Funds Trust, in a transfer of the leases and rents for cash, represents a liability encumbered by several properties which were transferred to State Farm in May of 2020. The extent of the liability, however, is beyond the scope of your understanding for moral and ethical consideration – should not be neglected by State Farm in this respect and on behalf of its investors.
      
I would recommend that you make arrangements to speak with me, independent of the ZUCKERS or their counselors, and to avoid any further “conflicted advisement”. If you feel comfortable holding the implied liabilities without speaking with me, I respect your decision and can only wish the best for you and yours in the future. 
      
I can assure you the underlying risks were obstructed by the counselors in the matter of 153974/2020; even having said this, I would implore that you make arrangements to discuss this matter with me directly at 646-256-3609, or via email at your earliest possible convenience. 
     
This is not a letter of demand by any means, and a good faith attempt on my own time to provide you with an unbiased opinion and a “non-conflicting” opinion to assist you. 
       
Most Sincerely,
        
Bo Dincer
Tel.:  646-256-3609
    
    
Thank you again for your guidance in this matter Judith, I will get back to you, and hopefully after speaking with Mr. Moore and State Farm in the coming week. 
           
Please enjoy your weekends, and also understand that I will help you to clear the risk of your involvement(s) with matters which pertain to item 50074, and more importantly — without a certain deluge of information of substantially harmful information, all of which has gone undiscovered and for several reporting periods.


BCC:     Miss Judith Craig
                Thank you for reaching out, I had intended to copy you on the previous message.
                TY, Kathy is looking into this as well.

THE LEASES AND RENTS FROM 117 SULLIVAN STREET WERE ALSO TRANSFERRED TO STATE FARM.
- STATE FARM "GUARANTEES" PAYMENT IF THEY FEEL THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL NEED TO, AND IN THIS CASE - THE CARRIED INTEREST IS MATERIALLY SUBSTANTIVE, AND ACCRUES ON A DAILY BASIS.

YOU CAN USE THIS CALCULATOR, WHICH IS A PROVISION OF THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ASSESS THE INTEREST AND TERMS OF PAYMENT FOR THE $6,000,000.00 YOU LOANED SULLIVAN PROPERTIES LP IN AUGUST OF 2020 FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE LEASES AND RENTS IN THE LOAN DOCKET 50074, WHICH WAS FILED AND OBSTRUCTED IN THE NYSCEF MATTER 153974/2020
