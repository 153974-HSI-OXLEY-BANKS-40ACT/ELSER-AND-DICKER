FOR INSIDER TRADING AND UNFAIR DEALINGS, I STAND WITH LAGARDE.
https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-18/s71418-4531826-176079.pdf
International Monetary Fund, then Managing Director Christine Lagarde affirmed,

“The industry still prizes short-term profit over long-term prudence, today’s bonus over tomorrow’s relationship."

Item B.14. Provision of financial support.
Instruction. For purposes of this Item, a provision of financial support includes any 
(1) capital contribution, 
(2) purchase of a security from a Money Market Fund in reliance on rule 17a-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.17a-9), 
(3) purchase of any defaulted or devalued security at fair value reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's portfolio, 
(4) execution of letter of credit or letter of indemnity, 
(5) capital support agreement (whether or not the Registrant ultimately received support), 
(6) performance guarantee, or (7) other similar action reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's portfolio.

Provision of financial support does not include any 
 (1) routine waiver of fees or reimbursement of Registrant's expenses, 
 (2) routine inter-fund lending, 
 (3) routine inter-fund purchases of Registrant's shares, or 
 (4) action that would qualify as financial support as defined above, that the board of directors has otherwise determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Registrant's portfolio.
